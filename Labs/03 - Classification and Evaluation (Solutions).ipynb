The 5 neighbours solution is a more 'complex model' (why?) and the mean class accuracy seems to be worse. The choice of model will depend on your goals. If you don't care about predicting `IE` correctly, the `1000` neighbour model gives greater overall accuracy and is a simpler model - therefore one would prefer to err towards using it. However, your application may tolerate a drop in overall accuracy in return for better 'class accuracy' in a particular output - in this case, you may consider the more complex 5 neighbour model to get better `EI` accuracy.\n",

The 10-NN model, while it gets more instances wrong (lower accuracy), has a better judgement of its confidence in the prediction, whereas the 1000-NN model gets more instances right (higher accuracy), but its judgement is way off (for example, in instances where it gets it wrong, it may predict the wrong label with high confidence, impacting the log loss).\n",
