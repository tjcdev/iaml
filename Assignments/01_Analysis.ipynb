    "## Important Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important that you follow the instructions below to the letter - we will not be responsible for incorrect marking due to non-standard practices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You *MUST* have your environment set up as in the [README](https://github.com/michael-camilleri/IAML2018) and you *must activate this environment before running this notebook*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "source activate py3iaml\n",
    "cd [DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "# Navigate to this file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the instructions carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the code/markdown cell where to put it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some questions which are **specific to those taking the Level-11 version** of the course (INFR11182 and INFR11152). These are clearly marked with the words **(LEVEL 11)** and must be completed by those taking the Level 11 course. Those on the Level 10 version (INFR10069) may (and are advised to) attempt such questions but this will not affect their mark in any way, nor will they get feedback on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The .csv files that you will be using are located at `./datasets` (i.e. use the `datasets` directory **adjacent** to this file).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered with 2-3 lines of explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to show **all** your code/working. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. **Do** use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer. Marks *WILL* be deducted if the marker cannot understand your logic/results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaboration:** You may discuss the assignment with your colleagues, provided that the writing that you submit is entirely your own. That is, you should NOT borrow actual text or code from other students. We ask that you provide a list of the people who you've had discussions with (if any).\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBMISSION Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** You must submit this assignment by **Thursday 18/10/2018 at 16:00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions:** The policy stated in the School of Informatics is that normally you will not be allowed to submit coursework late. See the [ITO webpage](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests) for exceptions to this, e.g. in case of serious medical illness or serious personal problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resubmission:** If you submit your file again, the previous submission is **overwritten**. We will mark the version that is in the submission folder at the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "All submissions happen electronically. To submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fill out this notebook, and save it, making sure to **KEEP the name of the file UNCHANGED**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On a DICE environment, open the terminal, navigate to the location of this notebook, and submit this notebook file using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```submit iaml cw1 \"01_Analysis.ipynb\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "  What actually happens in the background is that your file is placed in a folder available to markers. If you submit a file with the same name into the same location, **it will *overwrite* your previous submission**. You can check the status of your submissions with the `show_submissions` command.\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **Distance Learners:** To copy your work onto DICE (so that you can use the `submit` command) you can use `scp` or `rsync` (you may need to install these yourself). You can copy files to `student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk`, then ssh into it in order to submit. The following is an example (replace entries in `[square brackets]` with your specific details):\n",
    "```\n",
    "filename=\"01_Analysis.ipynb\"\n",
    "local_scp_filepath=[DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]${filename}\n",
    "server_address=student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk\n",
    "scp -r ${local_scp_filepath} [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}:${filename}\n",
    "# rsync -rl ${local_scp_filepath} [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}:${filename}\n",
    "ssh [YOUR USERNAME]@${server_address}\n",
    "ssh student.login\n",
    "submit iaml cw1 \"01_Analysis.ipynb\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marking Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The Level 10 and Level 11 points are marked out of different totals, however these are all normalised to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**70-100%** results/answer correct plus extra achievement at understanding or analysis of results. Clear explanations, evidence of creative or deeper thought will contribute to a higher grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**60-69%** results/answer correct or nearly correct and well explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**50-59%** results/answer in right direction but significant errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**40-49%** some evidence that the student has gained some understanding, but not answered the questions\n",
    "properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0-39%** serious error or slack work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this is not a programming assignment, in questions which involve visualisation of results and/or long cold snippets, some marks may be deducted if the code is not adequately readable."

    "## Description of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is based on the 20 Newsgroups Dataset. This dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware, comp.sys.mac.hardware), while others are highly unrelated (e.g misc.forsale, soc.religion.christian). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three versions of the 20 Newsgroups Dataset. In this assignment we will use the `bydate` matlab version in which documents are sorted by date into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, newsgroup-identifying headers are dropped and duplicates are removed. This collection comprises roughly 61,000 different words, which results in a bag-of-words representation with frequency counts. More specifically, each document is represented by a 61,000 dimensional vector that contains the counts for each of the 61,000 different words present in the respective document. \n",
    "\n",
    "To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we preprocessed the original dataset. We will use documents from only 5 out of the 20 newsgroups, which results in a 5-class problem. The class is conveniently stored in the `class` column. More specifically the 5 classes correspond to the following newsgroups: \n",
    "1. `alt.atheism`\n",
    "2. `comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware`\n",
    "3. `comp.sys.mac.hardware`\n",
    "4. `rec.sport.baseball`\n",
    "5. `rec.sport.hockey `\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note here that classes 2-3 and 4-5 are rather closely related. Additionally, we computed the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) of each word with the class attribute and selected the some words out of 61,000 that had highest mutual information. For very sophisticated technical reasons (which you should know!) 1 was added to all the word counts in part 1. The resulting representation is much more compact and can be used directly to perform our experiments in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: The data was preprocessed by a very busy PhD student... and hence should never be taken to be perfect at face value!"
